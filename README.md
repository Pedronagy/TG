## Final thesis

This is my university final thesis.  
Its all in portuguese and its a single pdf file. All content can be seen in the pdf itself.  
The title is "Automation effects on structual unemployment - solutions and previsions".  
Maybe github its not the ideal place to share it but i wanted to do it anyway along with my codes.  


>**Praxagora:** I want all to have a share of everything and all property to be in common; there will no longer be either rich or poor;  
>**Praxagora:** I shall begin by making land, money, everything that is private property, common to all.  
>**Blepyrus:** But who will till the soil?  
>**Praxagora:** The ~~slaves~~ robots  
>(Assemblywomen, Arist√≥teles, 391 A.C.)

Hope you enjoy it.
